# The idea behind the Belly Button Dashboard
The fictional company *Improbable Beef*, conducted research on bacteria to identify species that could be a candidate to manufacture synthetic meat. For the panel study, they asked the help of several volunteers. Therefore, volunteers should be able to access information about what is inside their belly buttons (the subject of the study) and be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species that live in their belly buttons.


The information obtained from the research must be simple to show but at the same time it must be complete, with the specific and particular information of each volunteer. So, we created an interactive dashboard, to show to each one, the whole information obtained form their navels.

# WhatÂ´s inside the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
- ID number Filter: the unique ID number of each volunteer; that way they can observe their results directly without having to see the total results
- Demographic Info: the particular information of each volunteer, such as ethnicity, gender, age, location, among others.
- Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found: an Horizontal Bar Chart that displays th top ten bacterias living in their navels.
- Bacteria Cultures Per Sample: a Bubble Chart shows us the frequency, or the proportion of the bacteria that live in the navel, the larger the bubble, the greater the population of that bacteria in the belly button.
- Belly Button Washing Frequency: a Gauge Chart that displays the frequency of washing the belly button of the volunteer.
